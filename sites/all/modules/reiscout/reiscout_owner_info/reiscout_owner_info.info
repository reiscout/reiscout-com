name = Reiscout Owner Info
description = Display buttons and control over points to get owner info
package = Reiscout
core = 7.x

files[] = reiscout_owner_info.module
files[] = reiscout_owner_info.inc

dependencies[] = userpoints
dependencies[] = rules
dependencies[] = rules_link
dependencies[] = services

dependencies[] = reiscout_connect2data_api
